# DynamicTRF

The code for [Dynamic modeling of EEG responses to natural speech reveals earlier processing of predictable words](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.26.609779)

This work depends on [nnTRF](https://github.com/powerfulbean/nnTRF).

## News
- [2025.10.21] 🚀 Version 2.0.0 has been released! with user-friendly function to start dynamic TRF analysis.

## Roadmap
 🔜 Planned | 🚧 In Progress | 🧪 Testing | ✅ Completed 

### v2.0.0
✅ remove dependency on the old mTRFpy  
✅ remove dependency on the old stimrespflow trainer  
✅ easier to use method for creating torch dataset required by the model, with code examples  
✅ switched to light-weight stimrespflow library, with light-weight trainer  
✅ user-friendly function to start dynamic TRF analysis, with just one call

### v0.0.1
✅ Refactor the code while reproducing results in the paper


## Installation

if installed in a machine with nvidia GPU(s) equipped, the cuda version of torch will be installed.

```sh
    pip install git+https://github.com/powerfulbean/DynamicTRF.git
```
